# S3K Game Overview

### Overview of the Game
S3K Game is a game that involves one person (Mr Peanut) against three enemies. The code base for this game was given for better improvement. This documentation gives a detail of new features that were added by SK3 group to better improve the overall experience of the users of this game. The Snapses of code and the explanation of the accompanying features are discussed in this documentation.


### Introduction to the code inherited:
The base code was inherited from the CSC 532 class. It was programed in C# and window forms were also used for its implementation. These codes were arranged into Frm battle, Frm level, Frm battle designers, Resource and program files. Each file corresponds to either a window form or performs a particular function. Additional file called Bdg Track was created for the background track or music.
